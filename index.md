# Research Projects

## Cell-cell interaction prediction
*2016-2023: PhD work under Dr. Gary Bader, University of Toronto.*  

My most recent PhD work focuses on predicting ligand-receptor interactions from scRNAseq data. First I leveraged our lab's experience making similar predictions from bulk transcriptomes to build [CCInx](https://baderlab.github.io/CCInx/vignettes/CCInxUsage.html). While considering approaches to improve the specificity of our predictions, I identified a flawed assumption underpinning the current state-of-the-art methods.  
**Skills learned/applied:**
- Data cleaning, supervised ML.
- Interactive and static data visualizations.
- Integrating scientific advances from other fields.
- Conceptualization and design of computational experiments, scientific writing.
- Remote coordination with biology collaborators.

## Analysis and visualization of scRNAseq data
*2016-2023: PhD work under Dr. Gary Bader, University of Toronto.*  

I began my PhD as high-throughput scRNAseq became available, and no best practices existed. A community of trainees came together to form the [Toronto scAnalysis working group](https://bit.ly/TOscRNAseq) to tackle this challenge.  Learning how to analyze this new data modality while contributing heavily to this community was the highlight of my PhD. I built and maintained a custom workflow and reporting tool based on our assessments of available methods, and expanded on it as needed for our various scientific collaborations.  This tool, [scClustViz](https://baderlab.github.io/scClustViz/) has enabled my collaborators to interpret their own scRNAseq data and [share our published results](http://shiny.baderlab.org/).  
**Skills learned/applied:**
- Workflow construction, package publication in R.
- Interactive and static data visualizations.
- Assessing and applying novel analysis methods.
- Designing computational experiments, scientific writing.
- Learning biology and experimental context from collaborators to fit computational solutions to their needs.

# Beyond academia, who am I?

I co-captain Team Innes - we ride every year in the Ride to Conquer Cancer in memory of my dad. To date, we have raised over $2M for the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre.
